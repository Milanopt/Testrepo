## Cable cross section calculator

`cable_cross_section.html` lets you compute the required cable cross sectional area for a specified impedance and length. Open the file in a browser and enter your values. The impedance range 1–16 Ω is supported.

1. Open `cable_cross_section.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter the impedance (Ω), length (m), and optionally the resistivity (Ω·m, default is 1.68e-8 for copper).
3. Click **Calculate** to see the required cross section in mm².
