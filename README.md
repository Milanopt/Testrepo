## Cable cross section calculator

`cable_cross_section.html` lets you compute the required copper cable cross sectional area for a specified impedance, length, and maximum allowed loss percentage. The impedance range 1–16 Ω is supported.

1. Open `cable_cross_section.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter the impedance (Ω), length (m), and the maximum loss (%) you are willing to tolerate.
3. Click **Calculate** to see the required cross section in mm².
