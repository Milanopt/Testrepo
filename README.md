## Cable cross section calculator

`cable_cross_section.html` lets you compute the required copper cable cross sectional area for a specified impedance, length, and maximum allowed loss percentage. The impedance range 1–16 Ω is supported.

1. Open `cable_cross_section.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter the impedance (Ω), length (m), and the maximum loss (%) you are willing to tolerate.
3. Click **Calculate** to see the required cross section in mm².

### 100 V system calculator

Below the first form, a second calculator lets you compute the cross section for constant 100 V systems.
1. Enter the loudspeaker power in watts, the cable length (m), and the maximum loss (%).
2. Click **Calculate** to see the required cross section in mm² for the 100 V line.
